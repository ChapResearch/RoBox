This is the main directory for the firmware that runs on the
RoBox itself. Included here is the main code for running the
robot as well as the code for driving the different peripherals
(sensors/motors/etc.) on the robot.  NOTE that the peripherals
MAY have different driving mechanisms depending upon the board
that is being used.

Currently we only use the Romeo board, so that is the only
one that is available. The directory "drivers" is where that
can be found.

These directories are organized to allow you to use both Windows
and Linux to compile Robox.  However, Linux is recommended, and
is currently the way in which the code is organized. But it
wouldn't take much work to use Windows.

LINUX
-----
To use linux, you need the following (see https://playground.arduino.cc/Linux/Mint
for more information):

- Arduino tool chain:

  	  sudo apt-get install arduino

- Arduino makefile
  	  
	  sudo apt-get install arduino-mk
