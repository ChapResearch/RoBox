	<h3>Challenge #7</h3>
	<h2>The 3 Lines!</h2>

        <p>In this challenge you will be coding your robot to go forward until it sees the 3rd line.
         It sounds easy at first, but you are going to have to use loops and your light sensor 
	really well or else it won't work</p>
	
<p>To get you started think about it this way. You already learned how to make
        </p>

	<p>I would suggest using a <strong>If</strong> statement that checks for the light
	  sensor value, inside a <strong>Repeat Forever</strong> block. Good Luck</p>
