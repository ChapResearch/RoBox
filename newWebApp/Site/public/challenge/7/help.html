	<h3>Challenge #7</h3>
	<h2>The 3 Lines!</h2>

        <p>In this challenge you will be coding your robot to go forward until it sees the 3rd line.
         It sounds easy at first, but you are going to have to use loops and your light sensor 
	really well to make it work successfully!</p>
	
	<p>Remember, you already mastered how to do this with one line!</p>

	<p>Try using loops and what you learned when stopping at a line in <b> Challenge 5 </b> to solve this problem.</p>
