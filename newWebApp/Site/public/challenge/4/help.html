	<h3>Challenge #4</h3>
	<h2>Drive To The Wall!</h2>

	<p>In this challenge you program your robot to
	stop right before it slams into a wall!  But how do you do that?</p>

	<p>Fortunately, the RoBox has an <strong>Ultrasonic</strong> sensor
	on the front! This sensor sends out a beep of sound and listens
	for the sound to return. It can tell how far it is away from the
	wall by measuring how long the sound takes to get back to the sensor after the beep.</p>

	<p>You will be using the <strong>Ultrasonic</strong> sensor block inside a <strong>Repeat Until</strong>
	  block. A <strong>Repeat Until</strong> block repeats a set of blocks until the condition is met.
	  The following would repeat a set of blocks until the <strong>Ultrasonic</strong> sensor
	  sees an object 20 millimeters (mm) away.</p>

	<p>Don't try to listen for the beep...it is much too high for you
	to hear.</p>
