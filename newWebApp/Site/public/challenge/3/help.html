	<h3>Challenge #3</h3>
	<h2>Drive The Perimeter!</h2>	
	
	<p>In this challenge you program your robot to
	Drive around the perimeter of a block 5 times.
	But that sounds like it would take ALOT of blocks, right? Wrong!</p>

	<p>You are going to be using a <strong>Repeat</strong> block to complete this challenge.
	This block allows you to repeat a set of blocks multiple times so you don't have to
	place every block yourself.</p>

	<p>For example the folowing <strong>Repeat</strong> will make the robot move
	forward and stop 3 times.</p>

	<p>Now how could you use this in your challenge?</p>
