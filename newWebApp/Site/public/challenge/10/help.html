	<h3>Challenge #10</h3>
	<h2>Light Up Lazer Run!</h2>

	<p>In this challenge you will program your robot to
	  Light Up all 3 LED lights and turn off one after another once you are shot.
	  After all the lights turn off, your robot should stop moving.</p>

	<p>You will be using the <strong>LED</strong> block and the
	<strong>Beep</strong> block.</p>
	
	<p>The <strong>LED</strong> block turns on one of the 3 lights
	on the robot, but it doesnt turn them off. So don't forget to use another
	<strong>LED</strong> block to turn them off when you're done! The
	following blocks turn on the first set of lights then turns them off a second later. </p>
