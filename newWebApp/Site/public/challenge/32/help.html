	<h3>Challenge #8</h3>
	<h2>Methods and Walls!</h2>

	<p>In this challenge you program your robot to
	get itself out from between 3 walls, like you did before, but this time using methods!</p>

	<p>This is what the best programmers use. Use the  <strong>Define Method</strong> blocks, and the
	<strong>Method</strong> blocks to create and run methods.</p>
	
        <p>The <strong>Define Method</strong> creates a set of blocks that all run
	when you use the <strong>Method</strong> block. This will make your program shorter and easier to read. You'll be like the proffesionals! </p>

	<p>Try to make a method that turns the robot and check for a wall. Then run that method everytime you want to check. Good Luck!</p>
