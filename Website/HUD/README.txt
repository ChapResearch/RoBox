HUD - Heads-up Display

  The HUD is meant for the mentor in a RoBox remote session.  This
  directory includes the code for the HUD for BOTH the HUD itself
  and for the App that needs some of this code to do it's thing.
  So all of the relavent definitions are here.  The App needs to
  be smart enough to come here to get stuff!

  To get to the HUD in the browser, you need to surf to /HUD.  There
  is a simple password you must know to access the HUD and it is
  "2468Appreciate" (only the stuff *in* the quotes - not including them).

  After you type in the password, THEN you can mess with the HUD.
