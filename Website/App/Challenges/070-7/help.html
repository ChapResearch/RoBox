	<h3>Challenge #7</h3>
	<h2>The 3 Lines!</h2>

        <p>In this challenge you will be coding your robot to go forward until it sees 3 lines.
         It sounds easy at first, but you are going to have to use loops and your light sensor 
	really well to make it work successfully!</p>
	
	<p>Remember, you already mastered how to do this with one line, so see if you can do it 3 times in the same program!</p>

	<p>Try using loops and what you learned when stopping at a line in <b> Challenge 5 </b> to solve this problem.</p>
