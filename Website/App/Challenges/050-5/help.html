	<h3>Challenge #5</h3>
	<h2>Drive To The Line!</h2>

	<p>In this challenge you program your robot to
	stop right when it senses the line!  This one is similar to your last challenge.</p>

	<p>Fortunately, the RoBox has a <strong>Light Sensor</strong> sensor
	  on the front! This sensor sends out light and looks at the light that comes back.
	  It can tell what color the ground is based on the light that bounces back.</p>

	<p>You will be using the <strong>Light Sensor</strong> sensor in a <strong>Repeat Until</strong>
	  block. Remember a <strong>Repeat Until</strong> block repeats a set of blocks until the condition is met.</p>
