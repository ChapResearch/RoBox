	<h3>Challenge #6</h3>
	<h2>Escape!</h2>	
	
	<p>In this challenge you will program your robot to
	Escape from inbetween 3 blocks!</p>

	<p>You are going to be using a <strong>Repeat</strong> block again to complete this challenge.
	  Try using what you learned while using the <Strong>Ultrasonic</Strong> sensor. That way your robot can check each
	  side of it before driving out of the blocks.</p>

        <p>When you are finished your robot will be placed inbetween the 3 blocks
        in a random position. So make sure it uses sensors to complete this challenge. Good Luck!</p>
