	<h3>Challenge #8</h3>
	<h2>Lazer Run!</h2>

	<p>In this challenge you will program your robot to
	Light Up and make a sound when its hit by an Infared (IR) Lazer!</p>

	<p>Now you have 2 new blocks, the <strong>LED</strong> block, and the
	<strong>Beep</strong> block.</p>
	
	<p>The <strong>LED</strong> block turns on one of the three lights
	on the robot, but it doesnt turn them off. So don't forget to use another
	<strong>LED</strong> block to turn them off when you're done! The
