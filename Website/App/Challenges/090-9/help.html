        <h3>Challenge #9</h3>
        <h2>Open Fire!</h2>

        <p>In this challenge you will program your robot to cross 2 black lines and then
           move back to the first line. It sounds simple, but that's not all. Once
          your robot reaches the second line, it needs to shoot a ball to the left
        and a ball to the right before heading back!</p>

        <p>To accomplish this challenge you are given 3 brand new blocks,
          the first of which is <b>fire shooter</b> block, which shoots a ball out of the
            shooter just like a cannon!</p>

	<p>The other two are the <b>start fire</b> block and the <b>stop fire</b> block. The start fire
	  block makes the shooter continuously fire until it reaches the stop fire block,
	  which tells the shooter to stop firing.</p>

	<p>You may want to experiment with these
	  two blocks in order to get a feel for the timing in between placements.</p>

        <p>If you get stuck, you can look back at challenge 7, <b>3 Line Time!,</b> for help. Good luck!</p>
