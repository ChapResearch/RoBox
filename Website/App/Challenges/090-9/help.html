	<h3>Challenge #9</h3>
	<h2>Sound Party!</h2>

	<p>In this challenge you will be coding your robot to 
	make a beeping sound that keeps getting higher and higher.</p>
	
        <p>You will be using <Strong>variables</Strong> for the first time.
          You will be using the <Strong>Special Beep</Strong> block to do this. You will also have to
	  use the <Strong>Math</Strong> blocks to change your variables.</p>

        <p>First use a <Strong>Variable</Strong> block to set <Strong>A</Strong> to <Strong>0</Strong>.
           Next use a <Strong>Math</Strong> block to add 1 to <Strong>A</Strong>. And Now use the
           <Strong>Beep at A</Strong> block to make a sound. Now try adding 1 to </Strong>A<Strong> and playing
           a sound multiple times. </p>
  

	<p><Strong>Hint:</Strong> use a <strong>Repeat</strong> block and the blocks mentioned above. Good Luck! </p>
