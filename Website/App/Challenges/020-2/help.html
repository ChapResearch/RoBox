	<h3>Challenge #2</h3>
	<h2>Drive And Come Back</h2>

	<p>Congratulations! You have succesfully made your first program.
	Now you have moved onto challenge #2</p>
	
	<p>In this challenge you will program your robot to
	drive away from you, turn, and come back.</p>

	<p>This time you will be using the <strong>Wheel</strong> block to move
	each wheel on your robot. To get started use a <strong>Wheel right</strong>
	block and a <strong>Wheel left</strong> block and set their power to
	100. This will make the robot move forward</p>

	<p>Now use a wait block to tell your robot to wait for a few seconds.</p>

	<p>Next make your wheels stop moving by using the <strong>Wheel right</strong>
	block and a <strong>Wheel left</strong> block and set their power to 0</p>

	<p>Everytime you complete a new program and want your
	robot to run it click the <img src="media/RUN.png" width="13%" /> button.</p>

        <p>You might notice that this only makes your robot move forward, but we want the
	robot to come back. Try changing the power on the first 2 <strong>Wheel</strong>
	blocks and see what happens.</p>
