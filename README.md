# RoBox
You have found the Chap Research and Team Appreciate (FRC2468)
RoBox github, congratulations!

The RoBox project was started in the spring of 2017 with the
goal to create a programmable robot that would be affordable
for anyone. While there are great programmable robot kits
available, they are often simply too expensive for people
on a tight budget.

So we set out to create an open-source software/hardware
robot kit that would target $30.  We're not there yet,
but moving in the right direction.
